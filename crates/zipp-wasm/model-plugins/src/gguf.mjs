/**
 * GGUF as a weight source, alongside Safetensors.
 *
 * The reader and the block dequantizers come from gguf-wasm, which is its own
 * project (https://github.com/f2i-com/gguf-wasm) consumed here as a pinned
 * release; this is the host side of that boundary. What matters
 * about the arrangement is that neither side ever holds the file: the header is
 * parsed from the first few megabytes, and every tensor after that is a byte
 * range this module reads through the same bounded `source` interface a
 * Safetensors model uses. A quantized checkpoint is routinely several
 * gigabytes, so holding one was never an option.
 *
 * Two things follow from the format:
 *
 *   * GGUF writes a shape fastest-varying first, the mirror of the convention
 *     everything here uses. Shapes are reversed on the way in, once, so a
 *     plugin sees `[rows, width]` like every other tensor and never has to know
 *     which file it came from.
 *   * A quantized row is individually addressable, because every block format
 *     packs a whole number of blocks per row. `rows` therefore reads and
 *     dequantizes only the rows asked for. For an embedding table that is the
 *     difference between a few kilobytes and a gigabyte, and it is why a
 *     vocabulary-sized tensor is usable at all.
 *
 * A tensor crosses into a graph one of two ways. `readTensor` decodes it to
 * float32, which is what a format the backends cannot read must do. `readBlocks`
 * hands over the file's own bytes and lets the backend decode inside its
 * matmul, which is what a format they can read should do: 144 bytes per 256
 * values instead of 1024, and the same result. `RESIDENT` says which is which.
